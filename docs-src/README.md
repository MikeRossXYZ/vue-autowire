Vue Autowire is a Vue plugin with [conventions](./conventions/README.md) for automatically wiring Vue assets:
- [components](./conventions/components.md)
- [views](./conventions/views.md)
- [directives](./conventions/directives.md)
- [mixins](./conventions/mixins.md)
- [routes](./conventions/routes.md)

First time here? Read how to get it [installed](./installation.md) on your project, then read through [the conventions](./conventions/README.md) used to register the different assets.
